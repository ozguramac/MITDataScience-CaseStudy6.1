# DSx
Hands on tutorials demonstrating the concepts of Prediction engineering, Feature engineering and automation in data science. In a series of notebooks, we show how we can build predictive models from raw data within a day - all using open source software.


## Open source tools used
- `pandas` is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
- `Featuretools` is a DARPA sponsored open source software that enables data scientists to automatically extract features from time varying temporal data.
- `scikit-learn` is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.


## Concepts to learn
- `Prediction engineering`
